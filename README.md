# Terminal+

Originally created to have 1 function, cleanup (wich clears the terminal). The MacOS terminal already had a terminal command to clear the terminal, but it didnt fully clear it.
Then the project expanded, and is what it is today, whit more commands than just cleanup.

Made for MacOS.
Works for Linux but requires moving more files.
May work for Windows but requires a lot of changes.

# Setup for MacOS:

Download the repository (https://github.com/Catlote/TerminalPlus)

Check if the downloaded TerminalPus folder is in:
Users/youAppleAccount/
If not, move it to Users/yourAppleAccount/

Then open the folder.
You should see 2 files:
* **tp**
* **tp.sh**

Then, run on your terminal:
<pre>
cd /TerminalPlus/
sudo mv tp /usr/local/bin/tp
</pre>
